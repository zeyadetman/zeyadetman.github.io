<br /><br />
The Greatest book of 'Aha!' Moments in math i've ever read.<br />the best thing i liked in the book that kalid didn't fill it with boring details that take us far away from the main point, another thing illustrations make it easy to understand, i finished it in 'E'day :D<br /><br />I think my next book will be calculus better explained.
