<h2>How it works?</h2>

the program takes the file path from user, then calculates its sha-256 hash, then takes the folder path from user to search in and start search for files with the same sha-256.

<h2>Installation:</h2>

<ol>
<li>install python 3.x from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a></li>
<li>create a new .py file and copy the source code into it.</li>
<li>run script.</li>
</ol>

\*NOTE: 'the folder path not included sub-folders'.

if you want to contribute, fork it.
